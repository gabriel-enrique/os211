# Top 10 List of Week 02

## 1. [LearnC](https://www.learn-c.org/)
This website is a great starting point when you want to learn the basics of C. Each topics such as variables, conditionals, loops, etc are packed into this one simple yet dense page for you to learn. Each topic will have examples and exercises for you to practice. They also have other languages other than C, such as Python, C++, Javascript, and more. This website is still my favorite website to visit when I'm learning a new language.

## 2. [Null Byte](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/)
This site has multiple guides for ethical hacking. They also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgTNupxATBfWmfehv21ym-g) containing live demos and implementation of a hack. I prefer watching or reading an article created by them because so far, they're the best among the others. Not only do they teach you how to hack, but they would also sometimes provide information on how to NOT get hacked. Sometimes I could pick a thing or two about cyber security by watching their videos.

## 3. [iluli by Mike Lamb (YouTube Channel)](https://www.youtube.com/c/ilulibyMikeLamb/videos)
This YouTube channel has some cyber security videos which covers the topic about phishing, DDoS attacks, malware, encryption, sim swapping, man-in-the-middle attacks, digital fingerprints, 2FAs, and more. I found the animation style of the video satisfying. The way the information is given is in a relatively good manner such that we can understand the topic well.

## 4. [Linux File Permissions and Ownership Explained with Examples](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/)
When I do an `ls -la` command, I become a litle iritated because there is just too much information on the screen, unlike Windows' `dir` command which outputs far simpler. Later I know that the leftmost column is displaying the files and directories permissions. I could simply understand, by common sense, that the `r` there stands for read and the `w` stands for write. However, there are mulitple `r`s and `w`s. Reading this article can finally fulfil my curiosity as it contains a simple in-depth explanation about the Linux file permissions, and even file ownership.

## 5. [What's your Favourite Programming Language? (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-rZOCn5rQ)
This video is about people answering a simple, yet sophisticated, question: "What is your favorite programming language?" The thing that piqued my interest is at the [1:58](https://youtu.be/p8-rZOCn5rQ?t=118) timestamp. He said that if he were to be stranded in a deserted island, he would choose C. Later in the video, at the [3:09](https://youtu.be/p8-rZOCn5rQ?t=189) timestamp to be exact, it turns out that C is suitable for low-level and high-level programming; which I found quite interesting.

## 6. [Comparing C to machine language (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOyaJXpAYZQ)
C is well known to be fast. Later I discovered that C is very close to a low-level programming language. This video compares machine code and C program head-to-head. I'm amazed at how simple the machine code is, no wonder why C is fast.

## 7. [What is PGP/GPG Encryption? In 3 Minutes (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-MPcUHhXoc)
This video briefly explains the very basic of PGP/GPG encryption. I think it's important to understand at least the basic concepts of the things that we will be using throughout the course. This video will not take you time, in return you get a simple but good insight about PGP/GPG encryption.

## 8. [Hacking challenge at DEFCON (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHhNWAKw0bY)
This video shows a little insight about DEFCON, a cyber security convention held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada. What amazed me is when the host got his phone account hacked by phishing methods. It turns out that a great software or hardware security is never enough, we also need to have a great 'human ware' security as well. The funny thing is about phishing in my opinion, is that when humans are advancing in technology, the security leak is not from the technological aspect; it is from the humans itself.

## 9. [Explaining Dirty COW local root exploit (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsshExn7aE)
Dirty COW is a Linux exploit discovered in 2016. From what I understand from the video, Dirty COW uses memory manipulation. It is amazing how a blend of computer organization and operating system knowledge can make this exploit possible. Good thing that we learn both subjects, so that in the future, we could use our knowledge to minimize exploits.

## 10. [Onion Routing (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRYzre4bf7I)
This video is about Onion Routing, an encryption method that use layers of encryption to send and receive data over the internet. I found the onion routing interesting because the overall encryption system is kind of similar to SSH. The use of keys to encrypt data brings that 'SSH'-feeling to it. From what I understand onion routing uses keys to transmit data, but with multiple layers, unlike SSH which only involves two keys: one for you and the other for the device you're SSH-ing into. So, data is transmitted between hops and decrypted one-by-one, It's secure because it's harder for hackers to do a man-in-the-middle attacks.
