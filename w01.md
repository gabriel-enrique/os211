# Top 10 List of Week 01

## 1. [LearnShell](https://www.learnshell.org/)
This is my go-to when I'm learning a new language (Bash in this context). There are individual topics (examples and exercise included) content there that will help you get a good intro to a language.

## 2. [ExplainShell](https://explainshell.com/)
You can check a Bash syntax meaning in this website. It gives explanations for syntax, arguments, flags, etc. You can just paste in a full Bash command here, and it will explain what this command does. It's similar to `man` or `--help`, but not quite the same. Go and try it yourself, and you'll get a better picture.

## 3. [Linus Torvalds Guides Tour of His Home Office (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE0JtUeyVJA)
This video is not about operating systems. However, c'mon, it's Linus "Linux" Torvalds' home office tour. It could give you some motivation to learn more about operating systems. At least it did for me.

## 4. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds (TED Talks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)
Another Linus video. In the video, Linus shares his experience when he's creatng Linux (and Git). The video has little insights about how he created Linux. Linus also talks about his backstory, which is kinda interesting. The video is quite long, but it's worth the time.

## 5. [Coding a whole web app ONLY using my Phone. (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KmUoTfGa34)
It's interesting how you can actually use your phone to code an actual project by using SSH. That way you dont actually need to have a computer to code. It's like what Badak is for, so that people can learn without actually having a computer. The video is entertaining as well.

## 6. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)
A regex tester. However, I have used this since my first regex experience. So, it's a bit more special than the other regex tester websites. The UI is, in my opinion, better than [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) which is listed in the Week 01 slides.

## 7. [MarkdownLivePreview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)
You can view your formated markdown file here. Looking at the [cbkadal os211 repo](https://github.com/cbkadal/os211/), it looks like there will be a lot of markdown writing in the upcoming weeks. This could help you view your markdown files as it would in GitHub, especially when the markdown syntax is everywhere in your document.

## 8. [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://vimsheet.com/)
It's really useful as a lookup reference when you're practicing your Vim skills. The more keyboard shortcuts you can memorize, the quicker you can go coding.

## 9. [Bash Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/bash)
Bash cheat sheet. Nothing more, nothing less. Just like the Vim cheat sheet, this Bash cheat sheet contains common Bash syntax. Very useful when you are in the middle of a coding session and forgot a thing or two about Bash scripting.

## 10. [Linux/Mac Tutorials (YouTube Playlist)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTvGhHkpvfmKWOiIPF8UVy6c)
This playlist contains videos about basic Linux commands (eg. navigating between directories; move, copy, delete files; etc). There's also some popular Linux commands explanation videos (eg. `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, etc). This playlist also has some videos about VirtualBox and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). My personal favorite is the Customizing Your Terminal videos.
