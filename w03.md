# Top 10 List of Week 02

## 1. [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)
This is a quick explanation video about the Linux File System. This video only took, more or less, 100 seconds to watch. In my opinion, this is the perfect video if you need to learn about the Linux File System in a rush. The explanations are clear, quick, and dense. Besides that, the video animations and design are satisfying as well.

## 2. [Linux File System/Structure Explained! (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)
This video has the same topic with the previous video. However, this video's explanations are more detailed and thorough. The guy from the video also does a live demo of him exploring the files inside the directories of the Linux File System, which makes it more interesting. It amazes me how everything in Linux is a file. I recommend this video if you have more time to spend learning about the Linux File System. Watching both videos is okay too!

## 3. [Linux File System and Windows File System, Difference (Article)](https://linuxexplore.com/2012/10/01/linux-file-system-and-windows-file-system-difference/)
I was curious about what differs between the Linux File System and the Windows File System. After the read, it turns out that they both have the same basic concepts. What differs is just the implementation. There is an interesting paragraph about the swap partition which makes Linux never run out of memory. I personally have gone through quite a lot of computer hangs throughout my journey with Windows. I wish I know Linux earlier.

## 4. [What is Linux swap? (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgefj9ibRE)
The video answers my curiosity about that swap partition that we need to make when we were installing Debian. I think the swapping method is a creative way to prevent system hangs and or crashes. The video also teaches us how to create swap partition and swap files which is useful if you have not done it to your system yet. Watching this does makes me curious, is there a Windows equivalent method of swapping?

## 5. [What is the Windows equivalent of Linux's swap file? (Q&A Article)](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Windows-equivalent-of-Linuxs-swap-file)
> **Extra links**\
> A brief video explanation about page files: [What is a Paging File or Pagefile as Fast As Possible (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)

After I learn about the swap partition in Linux, I was wondering whether Windows has a similar method to prevent system crashes and hangs. And it turns out there is, it is called **Paging File** or **Pagefile**. Windows paging method is kind of better than Linux's swap, because this way you can have more processes running even with low memory. However, it has its drawbacks, which is, it will make applications and programs runs slower sometimes.

## 6. ["Everything is a file" in UNIX (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDwXnB6XeiA)
I was mind blown. At first, when I know that everything is a file in Linux, i thought that the files were just some sort of placeholders. It turns out that those files are the actual (but not literally) backbones of the operating systems. The guy from the video demonstrates how the system use those files to execute commands that we use daily. Watching this makes me want to explore the Linux File System further. I guess I need to have an `.ova` file ready for backup.

## 7. [Linux File System Types (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7OkSvioFlU)
This video will tell you the difference between Linux File Systems. I only know about the `ext2`, `ext3`, and `ext4` file system before. It turns out that there are other Linux File Systems out there. The one that interest me the most is the `btrfs` file system which feature the Copy-on-Write method. `btrfs` file system is one of the newest Linux File System out there, and it is promising too. However it reminds me of my founding on [week 2](https://gabriel-enrique.github.io/os211/W02/#9-explaining-dirty-cow-local-root-exploit-youtube-video) about the [Dirty COW Exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsshExn7aE); the 'COW' stands for Copy-on-Write.

## 8. [File System Mounting - Linux (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ITr5ZpzvA)
when I was doing the FUSE tutorial, the word 'mount' is everywhere. So here I am searching for the meaning of 'mount'. It turns out that mount is similar to letting the operating system know that we want to use other filesystem, a USB drive for example. Unmounting is similar to ejecting a USB drive when you want to remove the USB from its port. From what I can infer as of right now, FUSE is like an internal "USB Drive" that we can mount and unmount to our file system.

## 9. [What is a TAR file? (YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euub2EAt8jQ)
On one of the assignments that we must do this week, we need to play around with `.tar` files. At first glance, I thought `.tar` files are like `.zip` files, which turns out to be similar. This video will briefly explain to you what `.tar` files are. The video also explains the variations of `.tar` files such as `.tar.gz` and `.tar.bz2`, the latter is the one that we use, tarball.

## 10. [What would happen if I did `rm -rf *` in the root directory? (Forum)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/437111/what-would-happen-if-i-did-rm-rf-in-the-root-directory#:~:text=If%20you%20did%20this%20(with,entire%20filesystem%20would%20be%20deleted.)
Back in the old days, I'm curious about what would happen if I were to delete System32 directory on a Windows operating system. Now that I'm starting to learn about Linux, that curiosity strikes back. This video can answer my question, without hurting myself in the process. What confuses me is why would the operating system allow you to do this command. Even though we own the system, what is the benefit of allowing us to execute `cd /; sudo rm -rf *`?
